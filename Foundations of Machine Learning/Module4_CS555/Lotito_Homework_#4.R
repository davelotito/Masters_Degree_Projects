#1. To get a sense of the data, generate a scatterplot to examine the association between 
#prestige score and years of education. Briefly describe the form, direction, and strength of 
#the association between the variables. Calculate the correlation.

# 2) Perform a simple linear regression with prestige score and years of education, 
# and briefly summarize your conclusions (no need to do the 5-step procedure here).  
# Generate a residual plot.  
# Assess whether the model assumptions are met.  
# Are there any outliers or influence points?  
# If so, identify them by ID and comment on the effect of each on the regression.

# (3) Calculate the least squares regression equation that predicts prestige score from education, income, 
# and percentage of women.  
# Formally test (using the 5-step procedure) whether the set of these predictors are associated with prestige score 
# at the Î± = 0.05 level (Hint: You should be performing the global test).

# (4) If the overall model was significant, summarize the information about the contribution of each variable separately at the same 
# significance level as used for the overall model (no need to do a formal 5-step procedure for each one, just comment on the results of the tests).  
# Provide interpretations for any estimates (of the slopes) that are significant.   
# Calculate 95% confidence intervals for any estimates that are significant




# (5) Generate a residual plot showing the fitted values from the regression against the residuals.  
# Is the fit of the model reasonable? Are there any outliers or influence points?
