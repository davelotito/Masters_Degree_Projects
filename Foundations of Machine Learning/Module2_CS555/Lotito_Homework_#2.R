# The shape of the two distributions are not normal distributions, we can see
# That these two distributions are not similar as the calories for non-participant spiked
# between 300-500 calories indicating that non-participants are likely to have more calories
# vs. the participants in the study. We can see that the participants had a lot of calories between
# 200-300 calories and then again at 400-500 calories. From our initial summary we can see that the sum of 
# total calories for participant vs. non-participant shows  us that Non_Participants consumed less overall calories
# but we also had less observations with 3 missing.

# (2) Does the mean calorie consumption for those who participated in the 
# meal preparation differ from 425?  
# Formally test at the alpha = 0.05 level using the 5 steps outlined in the module. 

# Steps
# 1) Set up the hypotheses and select the alpha level
# 2) Select the appropriate test statistic
# 3) State the decision rule
# 4) Compute the test statistic and the associated p-value
# 5) State your conclusion

# preparation. Interpret the confidence interval.
