# Test Yourself 6.2

# In the previous season, a professional basketball player made just 55%
# of his free throw shots. After working specifically with a coach in the 
# off-season the player is optimistic that he has improved his free throw percentage. 
# In the first few games of the new season, the player made 24 of 40
# free throws. Calculate the 90%
# confidence interval for the proportion of free throws that the player makes.

conf_90 <- 1.645
conf_95 <- 1.960
conf_99 <- 2.576

(24/40-conf_90*sqrt(24/40*(1-24/40)/40))*100
(24/40+conf_90*sqrt(24/40*(1-24/40)/40))*100

# We are 90% confident that the true proportion of free throw shots that the player is between 47%
# and 73%

# Question #1

# A study of stroke patients who survived 6 months after the stroke found that 6/45 men and 
# 22/63 women lived in an institution (e.g., nursing home or assisted living facility). 
# What is the risk difference of living in an institution between men and women 
# (using men as the reference group)?

# Question #2

#A study of stroke patients who survived 6 months after the stroke found that 6/45 men and 
# 22/63 women lived in an institution (e.g., nursing home or assisted living facility). 
# What is the odds ratio of living in an institution between men and women 
# (using men as the reference group)?

# Question #3

# A study of stroke patients who survived 6 months after the stroke found that 
# 6/45 men and 22/63 women lived in an institution (e.g., nursing home or assisted living facility). 
# What is the risk ratio of living in an institution after a stroke between men and women 
# (using men as the reference group)?

# Question #4

# A study of stroke patients who survived 6 months after the stroke found that 
# 6/45 men and 22/63 women lived in an institution (e.g., nursing home or assisted living facility). 
# What is the z-statistic for testing the null hypothesis of H0 : p1 = p2 , 
# where p1 is the proportion of men living in an institution after a stroke, and p2 for women?

# Question #5

# and 22/63 women lived in an institution (e.g., nursing home or assisted living facility). 
# What is the 95% confidence interval for the risk difference in living 
# in an institution between men and women (with men as the reference group)?

# Question #7

# We have 30-day follow-up data on 350 stroke patients and want to investigate whether the risk 
# of recurrent stroke and/or death depends on the type of stroke (cerebral embolism or not). 
# The results of the simple logistic regression of the dummy variable for cerebral embolism 
# (1 = yes, 0 = no) are shown below. Use the output to calculate the odds ratio for 
# recurrent stroke and/or death for those who had a cerebral embolism versus those who did not?

# Question #8

# We have 30-day follow-up data on 350 stroke patients and want to investigate whether 
# the risk of recurrent stroke and/or death depends on the type of stroke (cerebral embolism or not) 
# and age. The results of the multiple logistic regression of the dummy variable for cerebral embolism 
# (1 = yes, 0 = no) and age are shown below. 
# What is the risk of recurrent stroke/death for a patient without a cerebral 
# embolism who is 60 years of age?

# (cerebral embolism or not) and age. 
# The results of the multiple logistic regression of the dummy variable 
# for cerebral embolism (1 = yes, 0 = no) and age are shown below. Calculate the
#  odds ratio comparing the odds of recurrent stroke/death for a patient who is 65 versus 64, 
# controlling for cerebral embolism.

# The results of the multiple logistic regression of the dummy variable for cerebral embolism

# Question #16

# A study was conducted to determine key predictors of chromosomal fetal abnormalities. 
# Using the multiple logistic regression model and a cut off selected by the investigator, 
# 78 fetuses were predicted by the model of having an abnormality. 
# However, only 14 of the 78 that were predicted to have the abnormality actually did. 
# Of the 122 fetuses that the model predicted did not have the abnormality, 6 of them actually did. 
# Construct a 2 by 2 table of these results to help you calculate 
# the sensitivity of the model using this cutoff.
