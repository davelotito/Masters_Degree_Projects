# Module 2 Lecture Notes

# Section #1 - Probability

## Compute the probability of rolling two dice and having the sum of the dice be greater than 6.

## The outcomes are {(1,6), (2,5),(2,6), (3,4),(3,5),(3,6), (4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6), (5,2), (5,3),(5,4),(5,5),(5,6), (6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6)}

                  ### So, there are 21 possible outcomes out of 36. Hence, the probability is 21/36 = 0.58
                  
## Compute the probability of rolling two dice and getting exactly one 5 in the roll.

## The outcomes are {(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(5,6), (1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(6,5)}

                  ### So, there are 10 possible outcomes out of 36. Hence, the probability is 10/36 = 0.28 ###
                  
## Compute the probability that from a standard deck of cards, you will draw a J, Q, K, or a Heart on the first draw. Assume no Jokers in the deck.

## The total number of outcomes are 3 * 4 + 10 = 22 (J, Q, K from the 4 suits Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades + {A, 2, 3, ..., 10} from the Hearts). 

                ### Hence, the probability is 22/52 = 0.42 ###

# Section #2 - Sample Space

## The tosscoin function sets up the sample space for the experiment of tossing the coin repeatedly. The function returns a data frame object. The columns for the data frame are named toss1, toss2, .... The sample spaces for a single toss, two tosses, and three tosses are shown below.

tosscoin(1)

tosscoin(2)

tosscoin(3)

## The rolldie function sets up the sample space for the experiment of rolling a die repeatedly. The default for the number of sides of the die is 6. The function returns a data frame object. The columns for the data frame are named X1, X2, ...

## The following shows the sample spaces for a single roll of a 6-sided die and a 4-sided die respectively. The first argument is the number of rolls.
