# Module 1 Lecture Notes

# The following are student exam scores, lets get the average!
exam_mean <- mean(c(72, 22, 85, 89, 96, 77, 69, 78, 83, 92, 94))
print(exam_mean)

# The following are student exam scores, lets get the middle number!
exam_median <- median(c(72, 22, 85, 89, 96, 77, 69, 78, 83, 92, 94))
print(exam_median)

# The following are student exam scores, lets find the variance
exam_score_variance <- var(c(72, 22, 85, 89, 96, 77, 69, 78, 83, 92, 94))
print(exam_score_variance)

# The following are student exam scores, lets find the standard deviation!
std <- sd(c(72, 22, 85, 89, 96, 77, 69, 78, 83, 92, 94))
print(std)

# The following are student exam scores, lets find the five num summary
students_five_num <- fivenum(c(72, 22, 85, 89, 96, 77, 69, 78, 83, 92, 94))
print(students_five_num)

# Student test scores dataset
x <- c(72, 22, 85, 89, 96, 77, 69, 78, 83, 92, 94)

# Compute fivenum summary
f <- fivenum(x)

# Find Outlier: Outlier is 22 from the dataset
x[x < f[2] - 1.5 * (f[4] - f[2])]
x[x > f[4] + 1.5 * (f[4] - f[2])]

# Alternative is to get the summary - this computes all the above in one line of code
summary(x)

# Find the standarized variables of the exam scores from above ^ (x)
(x - mean(x)) / sd(x)

### DATA TYPES ###

y = 3.5
typeof(y)
mode(y)

# Create integer objects #
y_int <- as.integer(y)
print(y_int)
typeof(y_int)
mode(y_int)

y_int_2 <- as.integer(y/2)
print(y_int_2)
typeof(y_int_2)

# Return as a character
as.character(123)


# Concat strings with paste() function!

concat_1 <- "Dave"
concat_2 <- "Lotito"

paste(concat_1, concat_2, sep = "_")

# Return strings in specified format using sprintf() function!
day = "Saturday"
hour = "09:00"
sprint_f_test <- sprintf("This is a test at %s on %s", hour, day)
sprint_f_test

# Find the number of characters
nchar(day)

# Get substring of string "saturday" to just grab "day"
substr(day, start=6, stop=8)

# Substitute value in string
sub("test", "test_sub", sprint_f_test)

# For the student test scores in exam 1, use logical expressions to produce only the test scores that were 90 or above!

x[x > 90]

# For the student test scores in exam 1, use logical expressions to produce only the test scores that are multiples of 4

x[x %% 4 == 0]

# Using the ‘paste’ function, convert the set of student test scores from exam 1 into the format “Student#: score” where the # will represent the position of the score in the vector. DO NOT ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF SCORES OR STUDENTS IN THE CLASS. Show the R commands. E.g- Student1: 72, Student2: 22, etc...

paste0("Student", 1:length(x), ": ", x) # paste0 doesn't apply the default "space" sep
