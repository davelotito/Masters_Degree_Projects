# The following are student exam scores, lets get the average!

### DATA TYPES ###

y = 3.5
typeof(y)
mode(y)

# Create integer objects #
y_int <- as.integer(y)
print(y_int)
typeof(y_int)
mode(y_int)

y_int_2 <- as.integer(y/2)
print(y_int_2)
typeof(y_int_2)

# Return as a character
as.character(123)


# Concat strings with paste() function!

concat_1 <- "Dave"
concat_2 <- "Lotito"

paste(concat_1, concat_2, sep = "_")

# Return strings in specified format using sprintf() function!
day = "Saturday"
hour = "09:00"
sprint_f_test <- sprintf("This is a test at %s on %s", hour, day)

# Find the number of characters
nchar(day)

# Get substring of string "saturday" to just grab "day"
substr(day, start=6, stop=8)

# Substitute value in string
sub("test", "test_sub", sprint_f_test)

# For the student test scores in exam 1, use logical expressions to produce only the test scores that were 90 or above!

x[x > 90]

# For the student test scores in exam 1, use logical expressions to produce only the test scores that are multiples of 4

x[x %% 4 == 0]

# Using the ‘paste’ function, convert the set of student test scores from exam 1 into the format “Student#: score” where the # will represent the position of the score in the vector. DO NOT ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF SCORES OR STUDENTS IN THE CLASS. Show the R commands. E.g- Student1: 72, Student2: 22, etc...

paste0("Student", 1:length(x), ": ", x) # paste0 doesn't apply the default "space" sep

# The functions as.numeric, as.character, as.logical, as.integer, and as.complex are used for converting the given data into the required type. If the data cannot be converted, the value NA is returned
test_var <- 123
test_null <- NA

as.numeric(test_var)

as.character(test_var)

as.logical(test_var)

as.integer(test_var)

# In mathematics, a complex number is an element of a number system that extends the real numbers with a specific element denoted i.
as.complex(test_var)

# Check if value is null, returns boolean TRUE/FALSE
is.na(test_null)

is.numeric(test_var)

is.character(test_var)

is.logical(test_var)

is.integer(test_var)

# In mathematics, a complex number is an element of a number system that extends the real numbers with a specific element denoted i.

# Convert a vector of numerics to characters
char_x <- as.character(x)

# Section 3.6 - Vectors

## Since a vector is a collection of all values of the same type, in cases where different types are used during combining, the data is coerced to a common type. The type hierarchy is shown below.

# logical < integer < double < complex < character

ages <- c(20, 22, 25, 28, 29)
sizes <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

combine_vectors <- c(ages, sizes)
combine_vectors

# The length function returns the number of values in the given vector. For a numeric vector, the sum function adds all the values

length(combine_vectors)

sum(combine_vectors)

ages/2

2 * ages

# Arithmetic operations on vectors result in a new vector. If the lengths of the vectors are not equal, then the elements of the shorter vector are recycled to fill the gap.

first.names <- c("Mike", "Dave", "David", "Doreen")

paste(first.names, ages, sep=": ") # The first value of the first.names vector is recycled at the end to make it the same length as the ages vector

# Instantiate a vector of numbers from 1 to 10 inclusive
vector_test <- seq(1:10)
vector_test

# Instantiate a vector of EVEN numbers from 1 to 20 inclusive
vector_test_2 <- seq(from=2, to=20, by=2)
vector_test_2

# Section 3.7 - Indexing Vectors

ages[3] # Grab the 3rd element in the vector

ages[1:3] # Grab the 1st to the 3rd element in the vector

ages[c(1,5)] # Combine the 1st and 5th element into a new vector

is.vector(ages) # Returns TRUE if the given object is a vector.

vector_test_3 <- seq(1:20)

vector_test_3[c(3,7,10)] # return the 3rd, 7th, and 10th element of vector

vector_test_3[-length(vector_test_3)] # Return all elements except for the last element

vector_test_3[vector_test_3 %% 3 == 0] # Return all elements that are divisable by 3

# Section 3.8 - Sequences

20:25

2 * 1:5

n <- 5

1:n-1 # The sequence 1 : 5 is generated and the value 1 is subtracted from each member of the sequence

seq(from=2, to=10, length=3)

## The rep function is used to replicate the given vector. The given vector can be replicated the specified number of times if the second argument is a single number
rep_test <- c(1,5,7,100,56,42)

rep(rep_test, 3)

rep(rep_test, times=10)

### The each parameter allows each value in the vector to be repeated the specified number of times. In the following example, each element of x is repeated three times

rep(rep_test, each=10)

# Section 3.9 - Modifying Vectors

mod_vec <- 1:10

mod_vec[1] <- 1000 # Change the first element to 1000 instead of 1
mod_vec

mod_vec[c(2,5)] <- c(50,20) # Change element 2 & 5 to 50 and 20 respectively
mod_vec

mod_vec[length(mod_vec)] <- 0 # Change the last element to 0 assuming I don't know the length
mod_vec

# Section 3.10 - Named Vectors

## The names function assigns character strings as the names of the elements of the vector
names(ages) <- c("Mike", "dave", "David", "Doreen")
ages

ages["dave"] # Values of the vector can be accessed

ages[c("dave", "Mike")] # combine multiple values

names(ages)

### The contents of named vectors, like the contents of regular vectors, may be modified using the name indices or the numeric indices

names(ages)[2] <- "Derek"
names(ages)
