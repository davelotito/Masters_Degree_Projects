#####################################

# Suppose a student has 40% chance of scoring a perfect score in an exam with randomly selected questions. Each student will be provided 5 attempts.

# a) Compute and plot the probability distribution for the number of perfect scores over the 5 attempts (both the PMF and CDF)

?pbinom()

n = 5
p = 0.40

(pmf <- dbinom(0:n, size = n, prob = p))

plot(0:n, pmf, type = "h", xlab = "x", ylab = "PMF")
abline(h=0)

(cdf <- cumsum(pmf))

plot(0:n, cdf, type = "h", xlab = "x", ylab = "CDF")
abline(h=0)

# b) What is the probability that a student will score a perfect score in exactly 2 out of the 5 attempts?

n = 5
p = 0.6

pbinom(2, size = n, prob = p, lower.tail = T)

# Explicit Formula Calculation

p = 0.4
q = 1-P = 0.6
n = 5
x = 2

5*2 * (0.4)^2 * (0.6)^3

# c) What is the probability that a student will score a perfect score in at least 2 out of the 5 attempts?

n = 5
p = 0.4

pbinom(1, size = n, prob = p, lower.tail=F)

# d) Simulate the number of perfect scores over 5 attempts for 1000 students. Show the barplot of the frequencies of successes.

n = 5
p = 0.4

r = rbinom(1000, n, p)
hist(r)

# Part2) Negative Binomial distribution

# Suppose a student has 60% chance of scoring a perfect score in an exam with randomly selected questions. The student has to repeatedly take the exam until they achieve three perfect scores.

# a) Compute and plot the probability distribution for scoring the three perfect scores (both the PMF and CDF). The student will only go for a maximum of 10 failures before giving up.

n = 3
p = 0.6

(pmf <- dnbinom(0:10, size = n, prob = p))

plot(0:10, pmf, type = "h", xlab = "x", ylab = "PMF")
abline(h=0)

(cdf <- cumsum(pmf))

plot(0:10, cdf, type = "h", xlab = "x", ylab = "CDF")
abline(h=0)

# b) What is the probability that the student will have the three perfect scores with exactly 4 failures?

n = 3
p = 0.6

dnbinom(4, size = n, prob = p)

# Explicit Formula Calculation
#P(x = 4):
(6/2)*(0.6)^3*(0.6)^4

# c) What is the probability that the student will have the three perfect scores with at most 4 failures?

n = 3
p = 0.6

pnbinom(4, size = n, prob = p)

# d) Simulate the number of failures to get the three perfect scores for 1000 students. Show the barplot of the frequencies of the failures.

n = 3
p = 0.6

r = rnbinom(1000, n, p)
hist(r)

# Part3) Hypergeometric distribution

# Suppose that your professor created a pool of 60 multiple choice questions and 40 programming questions for the final exam. For each student, a random set of 20 distinct questions from the pool will be presented during the exam. The student has the opinion that the multiple-choice questions are easy to handle than the programming questions.

# a) Compute and plot the probability distribution for the number of multiple choice questions out of the 20 questions that the student will be given?
options(scipen=999)
M = 80
N = 40
K = 20
(q_a <- dhyper(0:K, m = M, n = N, k = K))

plot(0:K, q_a, type = "h", xlab = "x", ylab = "Question A")
abline(h=0)

# b) What is the probability that the student will have exactly 10 multiple choice questions out of the 20 questions in the exam?


### NEED TO REVIEW THIS, NOT CORRECT! ###
M = 80
N = 40
K = 20

dhyper(10, m = M, n = N, k = K)

# P(X = 10) = fx(10)
(80/10) * (40/10) / (100/20)

# c) What is the probability that the student will have at least 10 multiple choice questions out of the 20 questions in the exam?

phyper(10, m = M, n = N, k = K, lower.tail = F)

# d) Simulate the number of multiple choice questions for 1000 students. Show the barplot of the frequencies of the multiple-choice questions.

(students_1k <- rhyper(1000, m = M, n = N, k = K))

hist(students_1k)

# Part4) Poisson distribution

# Suppose that, on an average, students email 10 questions per day to the professor.

# a) What is the probability that the professor will have to answer exactly 8 questions per day?

dpois(8, lambda = 10)

# b) What is the probability that the professor will have to answer at most 8 questions per day?

ppois(8, lambda = 10)

# c) What is the probability that the professor will have to answer between 6 and 12 questions (inclusive)?

diff(ppois(c(5, 12), lambda = 10))

# d) Calculate and plot the PMF for the first 20 questions.

(pmf <- dpois(0:20, lambda = 10))

plot(0:20, pmf, type = "h", xlab = "x", ylab = "PMF", xlim = c(0, 22))
abline(h=0)

# e) Suppose the course runs for 50 days. Simulate the number of questions the professor gets per day over the course run. Show a barplot of the frequencies of the number of questions. Show a boxplot of the number of questions. What do you infer from the plots?

lambda = 10

course_time = 50

(number_questions = rpois(course_time,lambda))

boxplot(number_questions, horizontal = T, main = "Questions Per Day")
