### Part 1) Binomial distribution ###
#####################################

# Suppose a student has 40% chance of scoring a perfect score in an exam with randomly selected questions. Each student will be provided 5 attempts.

# a) Compute and plot the probability distribution for the number of perfect scores over the 5 attempts (both the PMF and CDF)

?pbinom()

n = 5
p = 0.40

(pmf <- dbinom(0:n, size = n, prob = p))

plot(0:n, pmf, type = "h", xlab = "x", ylab = "PMF")
abline(h=0)

(cdf <- cumsum(pmf))

plot(0:n, cdf, type = "h", xlab = "x", ylab = "CDF")
abline(h=0)

# b) What is the probability that a student will score a perfect score in exactly 2 out of the 5 attempts?

n = 5
p = 0.6

pbinom(2, size = n, prob = p, lower.tail = T)

# Explicit Formula Calculation

p = 0.4
q = 1-P = 0.6
n = 5
x = 2

5*2 * (0.4)^2 * (0.6)^3

# c) What is the probability that a student will score a perfect score in at least 2 out of the 5 attempts?

n = 5
p = 0.4

pbinom(1, size = n, prob = p, lower.tail=F)

# d) Simulate the number of perfect scores over 5 attempts for 1000 students. Show the barplot of the frequencies of successes.

n = 5
p = 0.4

r = rbinom(1000, n, p)
hist(r)

# Part2) Negative Binomial distribution

# Suppose a student has 60% chance of scoring a perfect score in an exam with randomly selected questions. The student has to repeatedly take the exam until they achieve three perfect scores.

# a) Compute and plot the probability distribution for scoring the three perfect scores (both the PMF and CDF). The student will only go for a maximum of 10 failures before giving up.

n = 3
p = 0.6

(pmf <- dnbinom(0:10, size = n, prob = p))

plot(0:10, pmf, type = "h", xlab = "x", ylab = "PMF")
abline(h=0)

(cdf <- cumsum(pmf))

plot(0:10, cdf, type = "h", xlab = "x", ylab = "CDF")
abline(h=0)

# b) What is the probability that the student will have the three perfect scores with exactly 4 failures?

n = 3
p = 0.6

dnbinom(4, size = n, prob = p)

# Explicit Formula Calculation
#P(x = 4):
(6/2)*(0.6)^3*(0.6)^4

# c) What is the probability that the student will have the three perfect scores with at most 4 failures?

n = 3
p = 0.6

pnbinom(4, size = n, prob = p)

# d) Simulate the number of failures to get the three perfect scores for 1000 students. Show the barplot of the frequencies of the failures.

n = 3
p = 0.6

r = rnbinom(1000, n, p)
hist(r)

# Part3) Hypergeometric distribution

# Suppose that your professor created a pool of 60 multiple choice questions and 40 programming questions for the final exam. For each student, a random set of 20 distinct questions from the pool will be presented during the exam. The student has the opinion that the multiple-choice questions are easy to handle than the programming questions.
