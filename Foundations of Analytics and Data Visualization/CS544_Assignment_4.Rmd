### Part 1) Binomial distribution ###
#####################################

# Suppose a student has 40% chance of scoring a perfect score in an exam with randomly selected questions. Each student will be provided 5 attempts.

# a) Compute and plot the probability distribution for the number of perfect scores over the 5 attempts (both the PMF and CDF)

?pbinom()

n = 5
p = 0.40

(pmf <- dbinom(0:n, size = n, prob = p))

(cdf <- cumsum(pmf))

# b) What is the probability that a student will score a perfect score in exactly 2 out of the 5 attempts?

n = 5
p = 0.6

pbinom(2, size = n, prob = p, lower.tail = T)

# Explicit Formula Calculation

p = 0.4
q = 1-P = 0.6
n = 5
x = 2

5*2 * (0.4)^2 * (0.6)^3

# c) What is the probability that a student will score a perfect score in at least 2 out of the 5 attempts?

n = 5
p = 0.4

pbinom(1, size = n, prob = p, lower.tail=F)

# d) Simulate the number of perfect scores over 5 attempts for 1000 students. Show the barplot of the frequencies of successes.

n = 5
p = 0.4

r = rbinom(1000, n, p)
hist(r)
