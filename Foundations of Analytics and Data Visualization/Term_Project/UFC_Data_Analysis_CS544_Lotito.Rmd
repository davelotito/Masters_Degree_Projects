# Dataset Overview

The following dataset is from Kaggle and contains the UFC-Fight historical data from 1993 to 2021. This dataset is a list of EVERY UFC fight in the history of the organisation. Every row contains information about both fighters, fight details and the winner. The data was scraped using beautifulsoup in Python and processed via Pandas. This is the preprocessed file where each row contains information about each fighter collected up until this particular fight and the descriptive fight details. In this file, feature engineering, missing data treatment and one hot encoding are already done. The raw files have been merged to form this dataset.

# Data Prep

Each row is a compilation of both fighter stats. Fighters are represented by 'red' and 'blue' (for red and blue corner). The stats include damage done by the red fighter on the opponent and the damage done by the opponent on the fighter (represented by 'opp' in the columns) in all the fights this particular red fighter has had, except this one as it hasn't occurred yet (in the data). Same information exists for blue fighter. The target variable is 'Winner' which is the only column that tells you what happened.

# Goal of Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to understand how long fighters tend to last in the UFC, who typically wins more often(Red or Blue), ages of fighters in title bout fights, and if you were to bet on fights based on color of the fighters corner(Red or Blue) would you be more likely to win on a specific color.

Although MMA is a demanding sport, in order to rise to the top the best fighters need to have years of experience in various martial arts. This would have us believe that the average age of fighters will be well into their late 20s to late 30s. So lets dig in and see what the data tells us!

# Wins by Color

First, we want to understand if a specific color gives any indicator if a fighter is more likely to win a fight. In the below bar plot we are showing the frequency of wins for Blue vs. Red fighter color.

``` {r, echo = F}
plot_ly(
  x = names(table(ufc_data$Winner)),
  y = table(ufc_data$Winner),
  main = "Red vs. BLue",
  marker=list(color = c("Blue", "Red")),
  type = "bar"
) |>
  layout(title = "Fights 1993-2021",
         xaxis = list(title = "Blue Wins vs. Red Wins",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "Frequency",
                      zeroline = FALSE))

```

### Wins by Color for Title Fights vs. Non-Title Fights

Since we can see that more red colored fighters are winning fights I wanted to see if the same applies when we add in another variable, in this case we are looking at fighting for a title. The results show that when fighting for a title, red fighters tend to win more often than blue fighters.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
barplot(table(winner_title), col = c("Blue", "Red"), xlab = "Title Bout vs. Non-Title Bout", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Fights 1993-2021 by Title Bout", ylim = c(0, 6000))

table(winner_title)
```
# Win Streak: Blue vs. Red

Now that we know that red fighters tend to win more often, both in title-fights and non-title fights, I wanted to analyze what the winning streak looks like for both red and blue fighters. The analysis tells us that red fighters tend to have longer winning streaks vs. blue fighters. This makes sense as we saw from the other analysis we did on wins. The distributions are similar, but we can clearly see that red fighters tend to have longer winning streaks vs. blue fighters. Both plots are right skewed as evident from the plots provided.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}

win_streak_blue <- ufc_data[c("B_current_win_streak")]
win_streak_red <- ufc_data[c("R_current_win_streak")]

par(mfrow=c(1,2))   
 
barplot(table(win_streak_blue), col = c("Blue"), , xlab = "Blue # of Wins in Steak", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Duration of Win Streak: Blue Fighters", ylim = c(0, 3500))
barplot(table(win_streak_red), col = c("Red"), xlab = "Red # of Wins in Steak", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Duration of Win Streak: Red Fighters", ylim = c(0, 3000))

summary(win_streak_blue)
summary(win_streak_red)

```
# Distribution of Data
## Fighter Ages: Blue vs. Red

How long do fighters last in the UFC? Whats the average age of fighters? What do the outliers tell us?

These are all questions that I wanted to analyze. As we can see from the analysis in the scatter plot that the majority of the fights are in their early 20s to late 30s indicating that as the fighters age they are less and less likely to continue fighting, likely due to the wear and tear on the body. We do have some outliers, of course, who fight well into their 40s and even 50s. The average age for the fighters overall is ~30. This makes sense as most professional athletes peak in their early to mid 30s.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ages <- ufc_data[c("B_age", "R_age")]

plot(ages, main = "Age of Fighters - 1993 to 2021", col = c("blue", "red"))
legend(x=48,y=45,c("B_age","R_age"),cex=.8,col=c("blue","red"),pch=c(1,1))

summary(ages)
```

## Ages of Fighters in Title Bout

Now that we know the average age of fighters in the UFC being ~29.5, I wanted to dive deeper into these age groups to see out of the population what is the ages of fighters that are fighting for a title. To do this, I filtered the data on title_bout == True and pulled in both the ages of the blue fighters and red fighters. Below is the the results. The average is slightly lower at ~29.25, but a negligible difference. 

This histogram also tells us that as the fighters gain more experience in the sport they are more likely to be in a title bout, but even with it tapering off at ~33 years old there is again another spike around 35 years old inferring to us that there is more older fighters that hold a title and are holding it longer or fighters are given a chance to fighter for a title as they get more established in their career before they retire.

``` {r, echo = F}
title_bouts <- ufc_data[ufc_data$title_bout == "True", ]

title_bouts_ages <- title_bouts[c("title_bout", "B_age", "R_age")]

ages_combine <- data.frame(ages = c(title_bouts_ages[,"B_age"], title_bouts_ages[,"R_age"]))

fig <- plot_ly(
  x = title_bouts_ages$B_age,
  y = title_bouts_ages$title_bout,
  name = "Blue Ages",
  marker = list(color = c("Blue")),
  type = "histogram"
) |>
  layout(title = "Age of Fighters in Title Bout",
         xaxis = list(title = "Ages",
                      zeroline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(title = "",
                      zeroline = FALSE)) 
  fig <- fig |> add_trace(x = title_bouts_ages$R_age, name = 'Red Ages', marker = list(color = c("Red")))
  
fig

```

## Fighter Wins/Losses: Blue vs. Red

After analyzing the fighters number of wins, number of wins in a title fight, and the ages of fighters I wanted to take a deeper diver into the overall picture of the blue vs. red wins & losses to see the bigger picture. As we can see from the box plot below that the red fighters are clearly the better fighters overall with more wins over the blue fighters. Blue fighters have less losses compared to Red Fighters, but we need to take into account that there has been less fights overall for the blue fighters as we can see from the data provided.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
wins <- ufc_data[c("B_wins", "R_wins", "B_losses", "R_losses")]
boxplot(wins, horizontal = T, col=c("blue","red"), main = "Red/Blue: Wins vs. Losses", xlab = "Values", las = 1, cex.axis=0.8)
colSums(wins)
```
# Central Limit Theorem

The central limit theorem states that the distribution of sample means, taken from independent random sample sizes, follows a normal distribution even if the original population is not normally distributed.

This is important because there are a lot of statistical procedures that require normality in the data set. As a result, we can apply statistical techniques that assume normality even when the population is not normal. Using the age attribute in this data set the applicability of the central limit theorem can be shown. As displayed in histograms below, the age distribution of all groups have a positive skew.


``` {r, echo = F}
set.seed(9386)

# Combine Ages into One Column
ages<- data.frame(ages = c(ufc_data[,"B_age"], ufc_data[,"R_age"]))

ages <- as.matrix(ages)


par(mfrow = c(2,2))

xbar <- c()

for (size in c(10, 20, 30, 40)) {
for (i in 1:nrow(ages)) {
xbar[i] <- mean(sample(x = ages, size = 10, replace = TRUE))
}
cat("Sample Size = ", size, " Mean = ", mean(xbar)," SD = ", sd(xbar), "\n")
hist(xbar, prob = TRUE, breaks = 15, main = paste("Sample Size =", size))

}


```

# Sampling

Sampling is a technique to select a representative portion of the population to perform different studies on. There are many different sampling techniques that can be leveraged in analytics including simple random sampling, systematic sampling, and stratified sampling. 

Simple random sampling is a basic sampling technique where individual subjects are selected from a larger group. In this case, every sample has the same chance of getting picked. 

Systematic sampling is a method where samples are selected via a fixed periodic interval. The interval is calculated by dividing the whole population sample by the desired sample size. The first sample is decided randomly within the first interval. 

Lastly, stratified sampling takes into the account that there is heterogeneity in a population. The population is subdivided into sub populations and the same percentage of individuals is selected from each sub population to make up the sample set. When looking at a normal distribution, the sample mean can be used as an estimate for the population mean. Given a certain confidence level, a confidence interval is defined. The confidence interval is range of values which contains the population mean with the given confidence level.

For this project the age of the UFC fighters population will be analyzed. Simple random sampling without replacement & systematic sampling will be utilized as sampling methods.

## Population of Ages
This simple histogram shows the distribution of the ages of all UFC fighters since inception of the sport in 1993.
``` {r, echo = F}

hist(ages, main = "Population of Ages", ylim = c(0, 2500), col = "darkorange")

mean(ages)
sd(ages)

```

## SRSWOR
Simple random sampling is when a specified sample is selected from the larger group or larger frame. Each person or object has an equivalent opportunity of getting selected. An example is if we have 4 firefighters, 6 cops, and 4 nurses and simple random sampling were to be used to pick a sample size of 5 any five the group of 14 could be picked.

``` {r, echo = F}

set.seed(9386)

srswor <- srswor(100, nrow(ages))

rows <- (1:nrow(ages))[srswor!=0]
rows <- rep(rows, srswor[srswor != 0])
sample.1 <- ages[rows, ]

df <- table(sample.1)

barplot(df, main = "SRSWOR", xlab = "Ages", col = "cadetblue4")

paste("SRSWOR Mean:", mean(sample.1))
paste("SRSWOR SD:", sd(sample.1))
```
as.matrix(sample.1)
## Systematic Sampling
Systematic sampling is when there are “rules” decided to pick the sample size. For example, if there were 10 houses on 4 streets. The “rule” could be that the sampling will start with the 2nd house and then every 3rd house will be chosen. There is a potential bias with this sampling method

``` {r, echo = F}
set.seed(9386)

N = nrow(ages)
n = 100
k = ceiling(N / n)
r = sample(k, 1)
s = seq(r, by = k, length = n)

sample.2 <- ages[s, ]

df <- table(sample.2)

barplot(df, main = "Systematic Sampling", xlab = "Age", col = 'chartreuse1')

paste("Systematic Sampling Mean:", mean(sample.2))
paste("Systematic Sampling SD:", sd(sample.2))

```
# Conclusion

As we can see based on the data analysis, if you were to predict who was going to win a fight based on age, color of fighter (red or blue) and if it was a title bout or non title bout you can easily take a look at the charts/data provided and make a more informed decision on placing a bet and/or a prediction on who you think will win or lose the fight. These are just some of the many metrics that are provided in the data set, we didn't even scratch the surface. There is many more metrics that we can leverage from this data to draw more conclusions on whether a fight will end in a knock out, submission, etc.
