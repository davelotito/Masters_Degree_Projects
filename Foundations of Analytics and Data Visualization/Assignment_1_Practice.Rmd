# CS544 Module 1 Review (Practice)

# Q1

## a) Assign the above data as a vector in the same order to the variable scores. Use this variable scores for the remaining problems.

(scores <- c(58, 46, 50, 90, 42, 52, 62, 44, 96, 92, 54, 82))

## b) Using the length function, compute how many students took the exam? Store the expression in the variable n. Use this variable for the remaining problems where required.

(n <- length(scores))

## c) Using indexing, write the expression for accessing the first two items. Store the expression in the variable first_and_second.

(first_and_second <- scores[1:2])

## d) Using indexing, write the expression for accessing the first and last items. Store the expression in the variable first_and_last.

(first_and_last <- scores[c(1, length(scores))])

## e) Using indexing, write the expression for accessing the middle two items. Store the expression in the variable middle_two.

(middle_two <- scores[c(length(scores)/2, length(scores)/2+1)])

# Q2

## a) Use median(scores) to compute the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable median_score.
(median_score <- median(scores))

## b) Using comparison operators, write the R expression for scores less than or equal to the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable below_median.

(below_median <- scores <= median_score)

## c) Using comparison operators, write the R expression for scores greater than the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable above_median.

(above_median <- scores > median_score)

## d) Using the sum function, write the R expression for the number of scores less than or equal to the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable count_below_median.

(count_below_median <- sum(scores <= median_score))

## e) Using the sum function, write the R expression for the number of scores greater than the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable count_above_median.

(count_above_median <- sum(scores > median_score))
