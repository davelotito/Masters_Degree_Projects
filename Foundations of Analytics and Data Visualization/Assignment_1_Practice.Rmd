# CS544 Module 1 Review (Practice)

# Q1

## a) Assign the above data as a vector in the same order to the variable scores. Use this variable scores for the remaining problems.

(scores <- c(58, 46, 50, 90, 42, 52, 62, 44, 96, 92, 54, 82))

## b) Using the length function, compute how many students took the exam? Store the expression in the variable n. Use this variable for the remaining problems where required.

(n <- length(scores))

## c) Using indexing, write the expression for accessing the first two items. Store the expression in the variable first_and_second.

(first_and_second <- scores[1:2])

## d) Using indexing, write the expression for accessing the first and last items. Store the expression in the variable first_and_last.

(first_and_last <- scores[c(1, length(scores))])

## e) Using indexing, write the expression for accessing the middle two items. Store the expression in the variable middle_two.

(middle_two <- scores[c(length(scores)/2, length(scores)/2+1)])

# Q2

## a) Use median(scores) to compute the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable median_score.
(median_score <- median(scores))

## b) Using comparison operators, write the R expression for scores less than or equal to the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable below_median.

(below_median <- scores <= median_score)

## c) Using comparison operators, write the R expression for scores greater than the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable above_median.

(above_median <- scores > median_score)

## d) Using the sum function, write the R expression for the number of scores less than or equal to the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable count_below_median.

(count_below_median <- sum(scores <= median_score))

## e) Using the sum function, write the R expression for the number of scores greater than the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable count_above_median.

(count_above_median <- sum(scores > median_score))

# Q3

## a) Using logical indexing and the results from Q2), write the R expression for all the scores that are less than or equal to the median value of the data. Store the expression in the variable scores_below_median.

(scores_below_median <- scores[c(scores <= median_score)])

## b) Similarly, write the R expression for all the scores that are greater than the median. Store the expression in the variable scores_above_median.

(even_index_values <- scores[c(scores > median_score)])

# Q4

## a) Using numeric indexing, write the R expression for the odd indexed values from the scores. Store the expression in the variable odd_index_values.

(odd_index_values <- scores[seq(from = 1, by = 2, to = length(scores))])

## b) Similarly, write the R expression for the even indexed values from the scores. Store the expression in the variable even_index_values.

(even_index_values <- scores[seq(from = 2, by = 2, to = length(scores))])

# Q5

## a) Using the paste function with LETTERS, write the expression for the following output. Store the expression in the variable format_scores_version1.
# You can assume there are no more than 26 values.


(format_scores_version1 <- paste(LETTERS, sep='=', scores))

## b) Similarly, using the paste function with LETTERS, write the expression for the following output. Store the expression in the variable format_scores_version2.

(format_scores_version2 <- rev(paste(sort(LETTERS, decreasing=FALSE), sep="=", rev(scores))))

# Q6

## a) Create a matrix with two rows using the scores data. The first half of the values belong to the first row of the matrix. Store the expression in the variable scores_matrix.
#The code should work for any size input data.
#You can assume that there are even number of values in scores.

(scores_matrix <- matrix(scores, nrow=2, byrow=TRUE))

## b) Write the expression for displaying the first and last columns of the above matrix. The code should work for any size matrix. Store the expression in the variable first_and_last_version1.

(first_and_last_version1 <- scores_matrix[, c(1, ncol(scores_matrix))])
