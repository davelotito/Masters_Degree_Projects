# Part2) Random Variables

# Consider a game which involves rolling three dice. Write the R code for the following.
# Using the rollDie function from the prob library, setup the sample space for this experiment with the probability space.
# For each of the following scenarios from a) through e), show the corresponding outcomes and the probability of that event. The sample outputs for b) are shown as example.

(S <- rolldie(3, makespace=TRUE))

# a) The sum of the rolls is greater than 6 but less than 10.
(A <- subset(S, (X1 + X2 + X3 > 6) & (X1 + X2 + X3 < 10) ))
prob(S, (X1 + X2 + X3 > 6) & (X1 + X2 + X3 < 10))

# b) All the three rolls are identical.
(B <- subset(S, (X1 == X2 & X2 == X3)))
prob(S, (X1 == X2 & X2 == X3))

# c) Only two of the three rolls are identical.
(C <- subset(S, (X1 != X2 & X2 != X3 & X1 == X3)))
nrow(C)

(C <- subset(S, (X1 != X3 & X2 != X3 & X1 == X2)))
nrow(C)

# d) None of the three rolls are identical.
(D <- subset(S, (X1 != X2 & X2 != X3)))
prob(S, (X1 != X2 & X2 != X3))

# e) Only two of the three rolls are identical given that the sum of the rolls is greater than 6 but less than 10.

(E <- subset(S, (X1 != X2 & X2 != X3 & X1 == X3) & (X1 + X3 > 6) & (X1 + X3 < 10)))
nrow(E)
