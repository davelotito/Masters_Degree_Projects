# Part2) Random Variables

# Consider a game which involves rolling three dice. Write the R code for the following.
# Using the rollDie function from the prob library, setup the sample space for this experiment with the probability space.
# For each of the following scenarios from a) through e), show the corresponding outcomes and the probability of that event. The sample outputs for b) are shown as example.

(S <- rolldie(3, makespace=TRUE))

# a) The sum of the rolls is greater than 6 but less than 10.
(A <- subset(S, (X1 + X2 + X3 > 6) & (X1 + X2 + X3 < 10) ))
prob(S, (X1 + X2 + X3 > 6) & (X1 + X2 + X3 < 10))

# b) All the three rolls are identical.
(B <- subset(S, (X1 == X2 & X2 == X3)))
prob(S, (X1 == X2 & X2 == X3))

# c) Only two of the three rolls are identical.

(C <- subset(S, (X1 == X2 & X3 != X1 & X3 != X2) | (X1 == X3 & X2 != X1 & X2 != X3) | (X2 == X3 & X1 != X2 & X1 != X3)))
nrow(C)

# d) None of the three rolls are identical.
(D <- subset(S, (X1 != X2 & X2 != X3)))
prob(S, (X1 != X2 & X2 != X3))

# e) Only two of the three rolls are identical given that the sum of the rolls is greater than 6 but less than 10.

(E <- subset(S, (X1 != X2 & X2 != X3 & X1 == X3) & (X1 + X3 > 6) & (X1 + X3 < 10)))
nrow(E)

# Part3) Functions

# Using a for loop or a while loop, write your own R function, sum_of_first_N_even_squares (n),
# that returns the sum of the squares of the first n positive even numbers.
# For example, if n = 5, the first five even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and the required result is
# 22 +42 +62 +82 +102 =220

sum_of_first_N_even_square <- function(n) {
  for (i in seq(1,10, by = 2)) {
    sum = (2 * n) * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / i * 3
  }
  return (sum)
}
sum_of_first_N_even_square(2)
sum_of_first_N_even_square(5)
sum_of_first_N_even_square(10)


# Now, without using any loop, write your own R function, sum_of_first_N_even_squares_V2 (n),
# that returns the sum of the squares of the first n even numbers.

sum_of_first_N_even_square_v2 <- function(n) {
  return (sum(2 * n) * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 3)

}
sum_of_first_N_even_square_v2(2)
sum_of_first_N_even_square_v2(5)
sum_of_first_N_even_square_v2(10)
