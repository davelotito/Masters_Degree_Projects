# CS544 Module 1 Assignment
## Student: David J Lotito

### Instructions ###
## The following sample data shows the scores of the students in an exam: 58, 46, 50, 90, 42, 52, 62, 44, 96, 92, 54, 82

## Do the following using R code with only a single expression for each case unless specified otherwise. The solutions should be generic and work for any length of given data. You can assume there will be an even number of values in the given data.


##### Q1 ######

#### a) Assign the above data as a vector in the same order to the variable scores. Use this variable scores for the remaining problems.

scores <- c(58, 46, 50, 90, 42, 52, 62, 44, 96, 92, 54, 82)

#### b) Using the length function, compute how many students took the exam? Store the expression in the variable n. Use this variable for the remaining problems where required.

n <- length(scores)
n
#### c) Using indexing, write the expression for accessing the first two items. Store the expression in the variable first_and_second.

first_and_second <- scores[1:2]
first_and_second
#### d) Using indexing, write the expression for accessing the first and last items. Store the expression in the variable first_and_last.

first_and_last <- scores[c(1,12)]
first_and_last
#### e) Using indexing, write the expression for accessing the middle two items. Store the expression in the variable middle_two.

middle_two <- scores[6:7]
middle_two

##### Q2 ######

#### a) Use median(scores) to compute the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable median_score.

median_score <- median(scores)
median_score

#### b) Using comparison operators, write the R expression for scores less than or equal to the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable below_median.

below_median <- scores <= median_score 
below_median

#### c) Using comparison operators, write the R expression for scores greater than the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable above_median.

above_median <- scores > median_score
above_median

#### d) Using the sum function, write the R expression for the number of scores less than or equal to the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable count_below_median.

count_below_median <- sum(scores <= median_score)
count_below_median

#### e) Using the sum function, write the R expression for the number of scores greater than the median of the data. Store the expression in the variable count_above_median.

count_above_median <- sum(scores > median_score)
count_above_median

##### Q3 ######

#### a) Using logical indexing and the results from Q2), write the R expression for all the scores that are less than or equal to the median value of the data. Store the expression in the variable scores_below_median.

scores_below_median <- scores[scores <= median_score]
scores_below_median

#### b) Similarly, write the R expression for all the scores that are greater than the median. Store the expression in the variable scores_above_median.

scores_above_median <- scores[scores > median_score]
scores_above_median
