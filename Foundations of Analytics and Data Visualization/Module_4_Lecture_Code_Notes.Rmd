#### Section #1 - Intro (Discrete Distributions) #### 
#####################################################

# Numeric variables are either discrete or continuous. The outcomes of a continuous numeric variable come from a measuring process while those of a discrete variable come from a counting process. In this lecture, the probability distributions of discrete variables are explored. A probability distribution for a discrete random variable is defined in terms of a list of all possible numerical outcomes along with the probability of each outcome. The list of all outcomes is known as the support of the random variable. The probability distribution is specified in terms of a function, the probability mass function that maps each outcome to its probability.

#### Random Variable Example - Number of Heads #### 
###################################################

# Let the random variable X be the number of heads observed when a fair coin is tossed three times. The support for X is SX = {0, 1, 2, 3}. For computing the probabilities, examine the sample space for the experiment:

# S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}

# Out of the eight outcomes, only one outcome (TTT) has the number of heads 0; three outcomes (HTT, THT, TTH) have the number of heads 1; three outcomes (HHT, HTH, THH) have the number of heads 2; and one outcome (HHH) has the number of heads 3.

# The problems on (PAGE 3) can be modeled in R as follows. The support set for the random variable and the probabilities for this distribution are:

(x <- c(0, 1, 2, 3))

(f <- c(1/8, 3/8, 3/8, 1/8))

# The mean of the distribution is:

(mu <-sum(x * f))

# The variance of the distribution is:

(sigmaSquare <- sum((x - mu)^2 * f))

# The standard deviation of the distribution is:

(sigma <- sqrt(sigmaSquare))

# The cumulative distribution for the random variable is:

(F <- cumsum(f))

#### Random Variable Example - Age of Students #### 
###################################################

# Suppose the ages of ten students enrolled in a class are 21, 25, 27, 23, 21, 21, 25, 25, 21, and 27. Let the random variable X be the age of a randomly selected student in the class. The frequency distribution of X is shown in the table on (PAGE 5):

(ages <- c(21, 25, 27, 23, 21, 21, 25, 25, 21, 27))

(ctable <- table(ages))

# The above contingency table is converted to a data frame as follows:

(dframe <- as.data.frame(ctable))

# The inputs for the random variable X are the distinct ages:

(x <- as.numeric(as.character(dframe$ages)))

# Similarly, the probability distribution for the random variable is:

(f <- dframe$Freq / (sum(dframe$Freq)))

#######################################
#### Discrete Uniform Distribution #### 
#######################################

# A discrete uniform distribution is a symmetric probability distribution where a finite number of input values are equally likely. Consider the rolling of a single die. The outcomes 1, 2, ... , 6 are equally likely, each occurring with a probability of 1/6. If a discrete random variable X has m input values 1, 2, ... , m, then X has the discrete uniform distribution when P(X = x) = 1/m , for all values of x from 1 to m.

# The values can be explicitly computed in R as follows: (The input sequence is 1..6 and each of the 6 probabilities are 1/6.)

(x <- 1:6)

(f <- rep(1/6, 6))

# The mean value is calculated as follows:

(mu <- sum(x*f))

# The variance is computed using the following formula

(sigmaSquare <- sum((x - mu)^2 * f))

# The cumulative distribution function of the above discrete uniform random variable is calculated as follows:

x/6

# Sometimes, the input values for the discrete uniform random variable are in the integer range [a, b], inclusive where a < b. In this case, the probability mass function is (SEE PAGE 9)

# The rolling die example can be modeled in R as follows. The probability, P(X = 1), is:

(m <- 6)
dunif(1, max = m)

# The PMF can be generated as shown below.

(pmf <- dunif(1:m, max = m))

# A plot of the PMF for the uniform distribution using the following code is shown below.

plot(1:m, pmf, type='h', xlab='x', ylab='PMF', ylim = c(0, 0.2))
abline(h=0)

# The CDF for the above distribution is:

(cdf <- punif(1:m, max = m))

# The CDF can also be calculated using the PMF as follows:

cumsum(pmf)

# The qunif function is the quantile function that is the inverse of the punif function, i.e., it returns the value for which the CDF is given.
options(digits=2)
qunif(0.4, max = 6)

# The data for a discrete uniform random variable can be generated in R using the sample function with the replace option set to TRUE. The following code generates the data for a fair die rolled twenty times:

sample(6, size = 20, replace=T)

# The following code generates five random numbers in the given range from 10 to 20:

sample(10:20, size = 5, replace = T)

# The following code generates ten outcomes from flipping a fair coin:

sample(c("H", "T"), size = 10, replace = T)
